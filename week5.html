            I have figured what I want in the ‘Music’ section. I want to create a playlist carousel that I will make and personalise. I want to have 10 playlists with at least 50 songs. I am quite worried on how that will be implemented because I was hoping to let the music play on the website instead of having the playlist be hyperlinked to a third-party website or app like Spotify or Apple Music. I was quite unsure of how the section would personalise my website as well.

            My target audience is another issue I must encounter. I will be placing music that I think is good, but I am not sure if that is what the audience would like to listen to that music or if its within their taste.
