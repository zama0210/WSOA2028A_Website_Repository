        <h4>Style Guide</h4>
    <h3><b>Colour Palette</b></h3>
    <br>
    
    <p>
        I used #F0ECE8 for the websites overall background. For the font colours, I used #FFFFFF, #223030,#1D1D1F and #F5F5F5. 
        I have a sensetivity to bright light(even with the blue light filter on my prescribed glasses), so I used that to better design my website.
        I looked at the beauty brand Rare Beauty as the source of inspiration for how I want to make my website more accessible.
        Although the background colour is quite bright, it doesn't hurt my eyes as much as using white as the background. I used #3A2D28, #959D90 and #E8D9CD for the cards placed on the Intention section, DevBlogs page, Portfolio page and Essay page. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3><b>Typography</b></h3>
    <br>
    
    <p>
        I made use of Leky Calgria and Montserrat as the main typefaces. Leky Calgria being used for Titles and headings and Montserrat being used for the body. Arial, Helevitica and Sans-serif were used in case of the main typefaces not appearing on the browser. I avoided using the numbers provided on Leky Calgria because they would show up as symbols and there was no correlation between the symbols and the numbers. It confused me so it would not be fair to confuse users too. That is not the end goal.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3><b>Goal</b></h3>
    <br>
    
    <p>
       The goal I have for the website is for the user to engage with everything else before engaging with the portfolio. The website should lead them to the portfolio. That is why in the navigation bar the portfolio page is linked last. It is a journey of discovering information. As they navigate through the webpage, be it them clicking on cards and being led to another webpage or not, the information should be unrravelled so that it is not jarring.
